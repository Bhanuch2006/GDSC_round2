# GDSC ROUND 2
I am really happy that I could make into round 2 in python technical domain, 

In this round I have have been assigned 2 tasks

    - Respond to user messages in the Discord server using the Gemini API.
    - Create, delete, and modify reminders for users in the Discord server. Users should be able to set a reminder by sending a message with the time
